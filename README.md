Bits and Pieces
===============

When I write small, one-off things, I tend to write things in such a way that they're only really useful for that one specific thing. However, I seem to keep writing the same things over and over again, and as I'm growing older, I'm growing lazier, which means I'll dig through my old projects to copy some code.

I'm tired of doing that, and facing the same problems I faced when I copied the code last time. As such, this repository will house all of those snippets/modules that I really don't feel like making proper libraries for, since they'll most probably need adapting for each and every project they're used in (and supporting each usecase in a "generic" library is tedious).

The code in this repository will cover a wide range of subjects and be of varying quality. Ranging from neat and reusable with minor changes to "why do you even need this" and maybe some "oh god what were you smoking". Take things with a grain of salt, no warranty provided, you're on your own if you use this.
